# Day - 01 exercice : Band name generator

# First we need to enter a input for asking the first to the user.
welcome_message_display = print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.")
first_question_to_user = input("What's name of the city you grew up in ? ")
second_question_to_user = input("What's your pet's name ? ")


# Now we need to get the input values and print her together.
print(f"Your band name could be {first_question_to_user} {second_question_to_user}.")
